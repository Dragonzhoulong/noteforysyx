An external library, also known as a shared library or dynamic library, is a collection of precompiled code and functions that can be reused by multiple programs or applications. External libraries provide a way to organize and distribute reusable code separately from the main program. Instead of including the entire code of the library into the program, the program links to the external library during the compilation and linking process.

External libraries offer several advantages, including:

1. **Code Reusability:** External libraries allow developers to share and reuse common functionality across multiple projects. This saves time and effort as developers don't need to rewrite the same code for different applications.
    
2. **Modularity:** By using external libraries, programs can be broken down into smaller, more manageable modules. This modular approach makes it easier to maintain, update, and debug code.
    
3. **Reduced Code Size:** Linking with external libraries reduces the size of the executable file, as it only includes the necessary code from the library, rather than duplicating the entire library's code in the executable.
    
4. **Separation of Concerns:** External libraries provide a clear separation between application-specific code and generic functionality, enhancing the clarity and maintainability of the codebase.
    
5. **Versioning and Updates:** Developers can update or replace an external library without modifying the main program, as long as the interface (API) remains compatible. This allows for better code evolution and maintenance.
    
6. **Sharing of Resources:** When multiple programs use the same external library, the operating system can share the library's code in memory, leading to more efficient memory utilization.
    

In C/C++, external libraries are typically distributed as compiled binary files (e.g., .dll on Windows, .so on Unix-like systems). To use an external library in a C/C++ program, the program must be linked with the library during the compilation process. The compiler and linker flags (e.g., `-l` for linking) are used to specify which external libraries the program depends on.

For example, to link a program with the `math` library in C, you would use the `-lm` flag:

``` bash

`gcc your_program.c -o your_program -lm`

Similarly, for `readline`, you would use the `-lreadline -lhistory` flags:


`gcc your_program.c -o your_program -lreadline -lhistory`

These flags instruct the linker to find and link the appropriate external libraries with the program during the compilation process.
